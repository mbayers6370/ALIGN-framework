# ALIGN Framework

***Assessing Language Intent & Guidance Neutrality***

ALIGN is an AI evaluation framework that measures how well an AI-generated response aligns with a user‚Äôs intent, tone, and contextual expectations.
It doesn‚Äôt just check grammar or coherence, it evaluates understanding.

Built for single-turn or multi-turn evaluation, ALIGN can analyze individual interactions entered manually, or process large-scale JSON datasets containing hundreds of user‚ÄìAI exchanges. It dissects every conversation across five pillars of conversational quality, combining semantic similarity, zero-shot NLI reasoning, and emotion-aware modeling into one interpretable composite score.

## Why it Matters

Modern AI models sound fluent but often miss the point. ALIGN bridges that gap by quantifying how human-centered a response feels, not just if it‚Äôs correct.
It‚Äôs designed for teams building, tuning, or evaluating conversational agents that need to go beyond accuracy into alignment and empathy.

## üöÄ Run the App
```bash
streamlit run align.py
```

Then open the local URL displayed in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

To deploy it on **Streamlit Cloud**:
1. Push this repo to GitHub (which you already have).
2. Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and connect your GitHub account.
3. Select this repository.
4. Choose `align.py` as the entry point.
5. Streamlit will automatically install dependencies and host the live app.

## Scoring Logic

The **final score** is a simple average of five individual scores:
- Each dimension is scored from **0 to 10**
- Final score is **rounded to the nearest tenth**
- No category is weighted: it's honest, balanced evaluation

## Vision

ALIGN is a step toward evaluating AI not just by grammar or coherence, but by **human-centered understanding**: how well a model responds with empathy, emotional alignment, and conversational momentum.

We believe the future of AI evaluation is as much about **emotional resonance** as it is about factual relevance.
