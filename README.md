# ALIGN: Assessing Language Intent in Generative Neural Systems

### 🧠 A system for evaluating how well AI responses align with human input—across clarity, intent, tone, and emotional resonance.

---

## 🚀 What is this?

This project implements a **multi-dimensional evaluation engine** that analyzes human-AI conversations through the lens of **alignment**. Instead of just judging whether a chatbot replies “correctly,” this framework asks:

- Did the AI *understand* the user’s intent?
- Was the response *relevant* and *complete*?
- Did it *match tone*, invite *engagement*, and carry *contextual flow*?

The goal: move beyond surface-level chatbot scoring and **evaluate conversations like a human would**.

## 📊 Pillars of Evaluation

Each response is scored on seven pillars:

| Pillar         | What It Measures                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intent         | Did the AI understand what the user was really asking/saying?   |
| Relevance      | Is the response topically and semantically aligned?             |
| Completeness   | Does the AI address key elements of the user's message?         |
| Flow           | Does it logically follow the previous exchange?                 |
| Clarity        | Is it well-formed, specific, and understandable?                |
| Adaptability   | Does the AI match the user’s tone and complexity?               |
| Engagement     | Does the response invite further interaction or fall flat?      |

A final score is computed using weighted averages and smart penalties to surface underwhelming, vague, or misaligned replies.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Dependencies
- `tensorflow_hub`
- `numpy`
- `re`
- `collections`
- `universal-sentence-encoder`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub numpy
```

### Run the Script
```bash
python align.py
```

You’ll see printed scores for each conversational turn and an overall average. The system runs on a sample transcript by default, but you can easily pass in your own data.

## 🔎 Sample Use Case

This framework is ideal for:
- Evaluating **LLM outputs** for quality and emotional attunement
- Building **feedback loops** for AI systems in mental health, education, or customer service
- Creating internal benchmarks for generative response tuning

## 🧭 Philosophy

This project is grounded in the belief that **language is not enough**—alignment is emotional, contextual, and layered. We’re not just asking “did the AI respond?” We’re asking **did it listen?**
